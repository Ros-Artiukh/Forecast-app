Forecast app.
The user enters a city into input field and has a detailed, visualised forecast for today.
Clicking on the link below this forecast, user is going to another page, which contains forecast for a couple days ahead (3, 5, week), no matter. From there user can go back. (use React Router).
Under the input field is needed to see last 5 cities you’ve looked for and clicking on them we see forecast for today again.
Request to API is going just once for one city in time till the page is reloaded, so it’s needed to use Redux state, please don’t use Local Storage.
Design is important for us, but we don’t have strong rules, use your imagination, CSS keyframes, transform and transitions are welcome.
You can use this (https://openweathermap.org/api) or another API you like.
